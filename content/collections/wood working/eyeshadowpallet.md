## Description

Made as a gift to house some high-end indie eyeshadows. These eyeshadows have crazy iredecent properties so they needed an equally elegant box. 

The box was made from walnut and spruce scrap which was sourced locally and milled by my brother. Black inlays were printed in resin and hold the eyeshadow disks.
