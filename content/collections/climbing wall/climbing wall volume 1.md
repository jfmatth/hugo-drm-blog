## Description
Volumes add another dimension to any climbing wall, and are a great way to add new moves and interest. The shape was modeled in Fusion 360 so that side lengths and angle measures could be easily calculated. Then the peices were cut out from 3/4" plywood The angles cut with a table saw and hex nuts were added before painting and assembly. 

This volume is lots of fun to climb with and I look forward to making more for the wall in the future.
