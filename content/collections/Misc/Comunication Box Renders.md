## The Task

Working as an intern at [Turner Engineering Corp.](https://turner-engineering.com/) I was tasked with creating wiring schematics and box renders for a bus communication proposal. Performed in addtion to my projects as "test asset manager" I had demonstrated my skills for CAD on a [previous project report]({{< ref "/collections/3dpritning/storagebox/" >}} "Storage Box Project Renders"), and they proved a valuable asset for this project.
