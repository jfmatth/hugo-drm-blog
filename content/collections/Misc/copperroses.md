### Process
---
{{< box "Copper roses appear incredibly complex, however the process is simple when broken down into parts. First the stem is made. For this rose, I formed the stem from a copper pipe, which was first annealed with a blowtorch to soften. Then it could be flattened out into a sheet of copper, and the different peices of the stem cut out with tin snips. This was then rolled up with needle nose plyers and a vice carfully until the desired shape was achived." >}}

{{< box "Next leaf shapes were cut out, and formed into shape with the vice. A cooper wire was soldered into the middle of each leaf, then carefully wrapped around the stem and soldered to it." >}}

{{< box "Then it was time to make the flower. For this flower templates were used to cut out the shape of each of the five layers of petals. Then each petal was textured with a ball pein hammer. Interstingly after anneling the copper for the petals, the surface gained an iridescent shimmer, which when viewed from the right angle gave rainbow reflections.">}}

{{< box "Each petal was then bent up and shaped to resemble a natural rose. After this the flower could be soldered to the main stem via the copper rivet inserted in it." >}}
