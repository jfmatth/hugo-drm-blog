Plein Air is a french term which means "in the open air" and refers to the act of painting outdoors. Although this style was the original style of painting, I was introduced to the concept by the youtube videos of James Gurney creator of the Dinotopia book series. 

I wanted to build my own setup to paint with in hills around my neighboor hood, and in the nearby Santa Monica Mountains. The main body is comprised of two bamboo serving trays from Ikea sandwhiched together. An adjustable lid support made from scrap metal allows the boxes to be hindged open and locked at the desired angle for painting. Paper brushes, and paint are stored inside while on the move, and washing cups and tripod are strapped to the outside. When deployed, the whole aparatus is mounted on the tripod via a 3D printed adapter underneath.
