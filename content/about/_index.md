I am a maker at heart, and have been creating things ever since I was little. I love 3D printing and 3D design. My other major hobby is leather working, a discipline I love for the beauty of the raw materials and all the skills, and patience mandatory for strong craftsmanship. 

Overall I am someone who loves to create, build, and engineer. 

This website is a place for me to document my projects and pasisons.
